  - Instance Variables are varibles that belongs to the object.
  - Attributes provide information about the object current state.
  - Instance Methods are methods which belongs to object and interact with it.
  - Encapsulation is a OOP concept that restrict direct access to the object.
  - Instantiation is the process of creating a object from a class.
