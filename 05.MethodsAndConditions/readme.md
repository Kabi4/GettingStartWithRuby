# Start with Methods and Conditions
 ## Kickoff and recap Methods
  - Method basically designed to reuse and follow Do Not Repeat(DRY) Concept. 
  - DRY concept should always be implemented.A developer never repeats himself.
  - Ex: Let assume you create a method to convert Military Time to Standard clock time.If you won't declare a method suppose in a programmer you want to convert two or four times the time hence you have to write same code 4 times or may be more but with method you write it once and use it as many times you want.This is the DRY concept.
  - Method is defiened with a set of ruby statements.
  - When method is used its known as invoking the method.
  - Only call the method with paranthesis when you send the parameter or arguments in it.
  - Ruby read code top to bottom so you need to first define method before calling it.
  - Method is define with `def methodName\n code\n end`.
  - Method name should start with small letter.
  - What ever comes between def and end will be executed when the method is called.
