# Basic Ruby documentation
 ## PUTS
  - PUTS method is user for printing things to console;
  - PUTS is wrtten as puts{a space} then code here ex: puts "Hello World!";
  - "" these marks denotes the string when something is inside these quotation mark it is consider as String;
  - PUTS can also print the integers ex puts 6; P.S: 6 should not be wrap with "" other wise it will be considered as String;
  - PUTS automatically breaks lines into another if not provided if you dont want ot break lines in code use(;) semicolon in the end of line to state that here once intruction has ended;
  - PUTS can also perform string or athermatic operation inside it.Ex: puts 3+2; puts "hii"+"there";
  - If nothing is provided in puts method it prints a line break that is a blank line;
  - In Every puts statement there will be line break every statement;
 ## PRINT
  - PRINT is very similar to puts it just do not break line at end of every command;
 ## P
  - P Show us the output more programmatically rather than visually;
  - P Show string with quotes;
  - Integer in there simple formats;
  - Line break with `\n` symbol which puts and print doesn't afford;
 ## Basic Arithematic
  - `+,-,/,*` are considered as operators;
  - `5+2` is considered as expression;
  - If we add integers arrays or string it will perform the given operation and gives the result;
  - If we divide as integer with integer it will yeild us with a result of integer ignoring the decimal points;
  - To solve it at least one of those numbers should be decimal so we can get `12/5=2.4`;
  - `**` expnential operator,`%` modulo operator;
  - example: `2**3 Gives 2*2*2=8`|`5%2 give remainder i.e 1 or 4%2=0`;
  - `Number should be 0.5 not .5 or -.5`; 
 # Comments
  - `#` Used for single line comments aything ahead the hash will be ingore by ruby while being in the same line as hash;
  - `Use #`multiple for multi-line comments;
  - `Use =begin {Comments here} =end` for multi-line comments;
  - For commenting out in Editors select the code you want to comment out and press `ctrl+/`;
