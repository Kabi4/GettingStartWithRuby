a = [1,2,3,4,5]
b = [1,42,3,12,31,43]
#getting intersection
p a & b
#interseting multiple arrays
p [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8] & [8,8,1,2,33,2,12,55] & [11,2,8,2,8,23,24,52] #resulting array will not contain duplicate values even they are common multiple times

## CHALLENGE

# create custom_intersect method which accpets multiple arguments
