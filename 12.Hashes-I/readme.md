# Start With Hash
 ## Intro To Hash
  - Array is optimal for sequential storing of object has used when there is no sequence required to store object.
  - A Hash or Hash map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs.
  - Hashes are often called dictionary or map or associative arrays in other programming languages.
  - Hash connects unique identifiers(key) to values(Object).
  - It just work like Dictionary like dictionary connects word to defination similarly hash connects key with object in Ruby.
  - Hash key and hash value can be object of any type.
  - Hash key should be unique.
  - Hash values have no restriction they can be repeated.
  - Hash should be treated as unordered.Means value should be fetch by key not order.
  - Hash is created with `{}`.
  - It made with the `Hash` class.
  - Ex: `emptyHash = {}`.

 ## Creating And Accessing A Hash
  - Key value pair decalre in hash with syntax as `key => value`.
  - Pairs are separated in hash with `,`.
  - Key are also case sensitive.
  - Values can we access with calling square method like array in hash but we have to give the extact same value for key with which we created.
