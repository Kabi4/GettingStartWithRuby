# Introduction to Data Types Numbers and Booleans
 ## Integer,Floats and there class and `.class` method
  - The simple whole Numbers without decimals are called integers.
  - The decimals numbers are called Floats.
  - Every same data type come from the same blue print called `class`.Class is the blueprint to build object that's why every Integers share the same properties and method though they are different in values.
  - Every Object has access to their class with method called `.class`.
  - The classes are `fixnum` for Integers,`float` for floats,`bignum` for big integers.
  - ex: `p 5.class` yeilds `fixnum`.
